// Cluster control plane is a hierarchical extension of the NSX-T control plane. It allows NSX to manage multiple clusters. There is an instance of cluster control plane in each managed cluster. The cluster control plane is responsible for the traffic management, span calculation and it can work on its own. NSX-T central control plane distributes high-level network configurations like security policies and groups to cluster control planes, and each cluster control plane computes and realizes the configurations on the managed cluster.
